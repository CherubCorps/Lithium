@@ LITH_TXT_INFO_DESCR_Revolver
Other than this weapon being made on Earth, all you need to know about it is
that it fires six Teflon-plated .50 Action Express rounds and loads with a
break on the top. Crack some skulls with it.

== LITH_TXT_INFO_TITLE_LazShotgun | Kaether Photon Rifle
@@ LITH_TXT_INFO_DESCR_LazShotgun
Made during a war on Earth by a long nameless company, this weapon excels in
penetrating enemies with pure energy.

A superconducting coil in the middle is used to channel tons of energy into a
photon accelerator at extremely quick speeds, recharged by cocking the gun.

Great for cooking chicken.

== LITH_TXT_INFO_TITLE_SniperRifle | Facer AM-49d Sniper Rifle
@@ LITH_TXT_INFO_DESCR_SniperRifle
An extremely strong rifle which fires .50 BMG rounds, able to destroy most
living targets completely and penetrate weakly armored vehicles.

The main production of these weapons spanned about 20 years, and they were
sold to mercenaries in bulk. For a long time, this rifle had been the sniper's
main weapon of choice.

@@ LITH_TXT_INFO_DESCR_MissileLauncher
Have you ever wanted a weapon that fires 2,100 missiles a minute? Don't lie to
me, I know you have. This weapon delivers.

The miniature missiles the X-400 launches are medium-yield, they won't hit as
hard as regular fare, but they will pack quite a punch with the rate you can
put them out.

Has an internal revolving chamber that holds 30 rockets, fired in trios as the
cylinder revolves. New ammunition can be loaded by shoving it carefully into
the underside of the gun, similar to a shotgun, thanks to a convenient
automatic rotation as it detects newly loaded missiles.

== LITH_TXT_INFO_SHORT_PlasmaDiffuser | Plasma Diffuser
== LITH_TXT_INFO_TITLE_PlasmaDiffuser | SYM4.3 D.640 PLASMA DIFFUSER
@@ LITH_TXT_INFO_DESCR_PlasmaDiffuser
A weapon which works similarly to the 68-n Plasma Rifle, however preferring
damage over rate of fire. The D.640's design comes from several older models
designed by MDDO, as well as newer components patented by Semaphore Inc.
