This is a list of files to be processed into ZDoom's LANGUAGE format by
the compilefs.lua script.

Lines that start with "in" change the currently processed file, and lines that
have an arrow in them are files to process. Otherwise, they're ignored.

The left hand side is the real file, and the right hand side is its alias.

Note that you can only use text files here. Any binary files will break ZDoom.
