@@ LITHEND_Barons_Jem
As you enter the portal you feel like you did that fated day many
years ago, but it's not just your jaw now. Your whole body feels like
it's been removed from this galaxy, and you're stretched across an
infinitely long corridor.

Sub-space travel feels like a soothing lull compared to this. As you
awaken on Deimos, you feel as if you've had a hangover, and woke up in
the hottest depths of the sun.

As you look around yourself, you notice the heat is not coming from
your body, but from everything around you. You check your depth meter
to find you've successfully entered Hell.

For a moment, you almost feel like crying, but steel yourself instead.
