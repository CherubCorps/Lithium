Project 114 is the current military operation you are enacting. Started by a
pact between OFMD, KSKK and your country's military, Project 114 aims to
destroy the dimension known as Hell, which is currently invading our own.

As of writing, only 3 of the 8 operatives sent in remain. Two robots, and
yourself. You are to act as the point man and only main force against the
threat. Failing that, you are to help open a pathway to the core of Hell for
other operatives to complete the mission with.

Your advisor is Adam Lambert, and 11 generals currently oversee his and your
actions on the field.

@@ LITH_TXT_INFO_DESCR_OPD2
After seven years of planning, Operation Deception 2 has finally gone underway.
Along with Michael, Zeke, Solomon, and three others, we are finally setting
ourselves free.

I wasn't expecting Solomon of all people, part of Order, to be the one to
mastermind this, but here we are, years later, finally doing it.

Not to be pessimistic, but I don't think any of us will survive this. It's just
statistically impossible. Even I may die. There are assassins after us and now
we're in Hell itself.

I'll need a Theophylline supplement after this is over.

@@ LITH_TXT_INFO_DESCR_BIP
The Biotic Information Panel, or B.I.P. (sometimes "BIP,") is a program written
in portable C150 which gathers information from local area networks on various
subjects. When it is triggered to look up a subject, it also looks for relevant
information either related to or mentioned by the subject.

The program is extremely popular because of its simple, yet useful, function.
It is distributed freely by the Software Sans Pretium Foundation, and the
software is included in most C/B operating system bases.

The latest version of the software is 2.5, and since version 2.0 it has had
automatic update functionality.

One of the biggest advancements in technology over the past thousand years, a
Computer/Brain Interface, or C/B I (sometimes "CBI,") is an interface between
a human brain and a computer. Usually installed within the skull and the brain,
as well as in other areas of the central nervous system, a C/B I is a machine
with almost infinite uses.

Computer/Brain Interfaces are not classified as prosthetics, only enhancements,
as they do not replace any part of the body and only add onto it. The C/B I
currently installed is a self-servicing military model.
