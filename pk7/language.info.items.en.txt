   "The Weapon Interfacing Device Package (or simply Weapon Interface) is a small, "

   "modifying any kind of weaponry with extreme ease; In fact, it is built to "
   "completely disassemble, install upgrades into, and reassemble a weapon in under "
   "20 seconds."
   "\n\n"
   "The package was created approximately 30 years ago by researchers at OFMD and "
   "AllPoint. Them both seeing the potential sales figures for such a device during "
   "a great war, OFMD and AllPoint signed a mutual contract to develop the package "
   "and share profits between eachother."
   "\n\n"
   "The success of this device was massive, despite how expensive it is, with its "
   "prices being barred by a \"call us to get the numbers.\"";

   "markings in some foreign language you can't read."
