   "Your weapons have been deployed to various locations we were able to send other people to.  Do take care of them, acquiring the correct armaments for your job was quite expensive and now we've probably lost a few people.\n"
   "\n"
   "Besides being deployed with your pistol and combat knife (as you requested), you have been sent these five weapons:\n"
   "\n"
   "1. A combat-modified military model Hiku Mk.2 Shotgun, manufactured by Omakeda.\n"
   ">  This weapon was chosen because it has a powerful plasma shot that can\n"
   ">  penetrate the demons' armour.  Besides this, it has low recoil and an easy\n"
   ">  to handle pump-action loading system.  It has hopefully been deployed to\n"
   ">  the most convenient location you shall come across.\n"
   "\n"
   "2. An AllPoint 75-b Assault Rifle.\n"
   ">  You shall be fighting hordes of lower ranking demons and un-dead which are\n"
   ">  quite vulnerable to small arms fire and explosives, so naturally this gun\n"
   ">  was our first choice.  Equipped with a box magazine and inbuilt grenade\n"
   ">  launcher, capable of eliminating most lower tier threats.\n"
   "\n"
   "3. A Grenade Launcher, manufactured by Sym 4.3.\n"
   ">  With this, you can completely obliterate larger targets and crowds of\n"
   ">  demons.  Unfortunately, due to its weight, we were not able to get it in\n"
   ">  any convenient location.\n"
   "\n"
   "4. An AllPoint 68-n Plasma Rifle.\n"
   ">  This weapon does extreme damage to anything living, but some of the tougher\n"
   ">  demons seem to mitigate its damage.  Regardless, it has been sent to you\n"
   ">  because it can shred through demons with high rank.\n"
   "\n"
   "5. The Omega Cannon.\n"
   ">  I myself am not sure why high order would bother giving you such an\n"
   ">  expensive and dangerous piece of equipment, but you must have been sent\n"
   ">  this artifact for the purpose of destroying *something*.\n"
   "\n"
   "6. A KSKK Utsu-denka-sou assault bracelet.\n"
   ">  A weapon that may prove useful against weak and strong enemies alike, it's\n"
   ">  been sent to an unknown location, unfortunately. Don't be tricked by the\n"
   ">  appearance of it. Even if it just looks like a fancy bracelet, it is capable\n"
   ">  of outputting several tons of weight out your fist.\n"
   "\n"
   "You will also be able to purchase the weapons you designated, in your words, as \"must-have\" in the Shop.  I warn you that these weapons may not be as effective as you think; we spent quite a lot of time making sure that the arms we sent you were top-notch.\n"
