Your weapons have been deployed to various locations we were able to send other people to.  Do take care of them, acquiring the correct armaments for your job was quite expensive and now we've probably lost a few people.

Besides being deployed with your pistol and combat knife (as you requested), you have been sent these five weapons:

1. A combat-modified military model Hiku Mk.2 Shotgun, manufactured by Omakeda.
>  This weapon was chosen because it has a powerful plasma shot that can
>  penetrate the demons' armour.  Besides this, it has low recoil and an easy
>  to handle pump-action loading system.  It has hopefully been deployed to
>  the most convenient location you shall come across.

2. An AllPoint 75-b Assault Rifle.
>  You shall be fighting hordes of lower ranking demons and un-dead which are
>  quite vulnerable to small arms fire and explosives, so naturally this gun
>  was our first choice.  Equipped with a box magazine and inbuilt grenade
>  launcher, capable of eliminating most lower tier threats.

3. A Grenade Launcher, manufactured by Sym 4.3.
>  With this, you can completely obliterate larger targets and crowds of
>  demons.  Unfortunately, due to its weight, we were not able to get it in
>  any convenient location.

4. An AllPoint 68-n Plasma Rifle.
>  This weapon does extreme damage to anything living, but some of the tougher
>  demons seem to mitigate its damage.  Regardless, it has been sent to you
>  because it can shred through demons with high rank.

5. The Omega Cannon.
>  I myself am not sure why high order would bother giving you such an
>  expensive and dangerous piece of equipment, but you must have been sent
>  this artifact for the purpose of destroying *something*.

6. A KSKK Utsu-denka-sou assault bracelet.
>  A weapon that may prove useful against weak and strong enemies alike, it's
>  been sent to an unknown location, unfortunately. Don't be tricked by the
>  appearance of it. Even if it just looks like a fancy bracelet, it is capable
>  of outputting several tons of weight out your fist.

You will also be able to purchase the weapons you designated, in your words, as "must-have" in the Shop.  I warn you that these weapons may not be as effective as you think; we spent quite a lot of time making sure that the arms we sent you were top-notch.

Lambert out.  Good luck, Blazkowicz.

An explosion of some sort just happened nearby, it seems that the
demons are reconstructing the world around you. You would best be
careful not to trigger any other, er, events.

Enough of those and the whole world around you might collapse!

You've been making good progress so far. Your military superiors seem
to be considering giving you a promotion, even.

Lambert out.

There has been a change of plans going down the whole chain of
command.

Your status as a military operative is now canceled, and you are to
enter a full-on suicide mission funded by OFMD alone.

There is an artifact nearby that we have sent you. Once it is in your
possession, immediately destroy it, and you will be transported to a
city somewhere in Hell. Command will await afterwards.

Lambert out.

Hello, it has been forwarded to me that your Computer/Brain Interface
hardware was not properly upgraded for this mission. I've had several
communications errors with your secondary employers, and it is truly
starting to get annoying.

Due to failure to communicate with OFMD, I've taken it upon myself to
send your hardware upgrades through several proxy agents.

They may all be dead now. I have no idea, really. Hopefully you will
survive whatever they didn't. Anyways, as for the important part of
this message, here is a list of all the hardware that has been sent:

Two CPU/RAM upgrade packages. The first one is a powerful BC-0265
processor and 500TiB of RAM. Unfortunately, something horrible appears
to have happened to the agent carrying it, and so a secondary package
has been sent, containing temporary replacements: a Z6808 and 100TiB
of RAM.

One Armor Interface. A PCB and a set of emplacements on your armor.

One Weapon Modification Device, as its name implies.

One Weapon Refactoring Device, which can perform large modifications
on guns.

See you.

This place stinks of rotten flesh! I wonder what's going on here,
these blue walls sure seem out of place for Hell...

Perhaps some sinners are waiting to eat my rockets!

Now I've done it, this place just keeps going deeper and getting
weirder... Damn, it's getting hot in here! Better turn up the heat
some more.
