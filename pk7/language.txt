I couldn't brief you on this beforehand, but now that we have some privacy, here's what this thing can do:\n\nSo, running our own code is too risky, as you know. The ASIC would catch it right away. But what we can do is get the kernel to execute code for us, specifically when it's already in ring 0. Well, you may have noticed Solomon's name in the mission parameters looked a bit off. Since he was the instructor, we set his name to overflow a certain buffer during a kernel call, overflowing straight into a function pointer. Just point that right next to the fixed address, and bam. Kiloword boundaries give us plenty of space to write a self-modifying program in that padding space.\n\nThis also included some other vital parts besides the lock remover and the decompiler, mainly the graphics for your weapon materializers. (Sorry they don't look so great, the raw optic nerve image format is rather large.) The generational program will within a few minutes give you a working decompiler and within half an hour it'll be ready to start going at the ROM sources. From there it'll embed itself into the ROM and your mind will have fully returned to you by the end of the day.\n\nNow, what it can't do: Get rid of the ASIC chip. You will have to be careful not to trip it, but for the most part, it just doesn't have permissions to track anything we're doing. You should be able to mitigate it in a few ways since this program removes all of the hooks in the kernel that call into it, but you'll have to do them yourself. I'm sure you can. Good luck. Zeke.";

A combat-modified military model Hiku Mk.2 Shotgun, manufactured by Omakeda.\n>  This weapon was chosen because it has a powerful plasma shot that can\n>  penetrate the demons' armour.  Besides this, it has low recoil and an easy\n>  to handle pump-action loading system.  It has hopefully been deployed to\n>  the most convenient location you shall come across.\n\n2.

Equipped with a box magazine and inbuilt grenade\n>  launcher, capable of eliminating most lower tier threats.\n\n3. A Grenade Launcher, manufactured by Sym 4.3.\n>  With this, you can completely obliterate larger targets and crowds of\n>  demons.  Unfortunately, due to its weight, we were not able to get it in\n>  any convenient location.\n\n4. An AllPoint 68-n Plasma Rifle.\n>  This weapon does extreme damage to anything living, but some of the tougher\n>  demons seem to mitigate its damage.  Regardless, it has been sent to you\n>  because it can shred through demons with high rank.\n\n5. The Omega Cannon.\n>  I myself am not sure why high order would bother giving you such an\n>  expensive and dangerous piece of equipment, but you must have been sent\n>  this artifact for the purpose of destroying *something*.\n\n6. A KSKK Utsu-denka-sou assault bracelet.\n>  A weapon that may prove useful against weak and strong enemies alike, it's\n>  been sent to an unknown location, unfortunately. Don't be tricked by the\n>  appearance of it. Even if it just looks like a fancy bracelet, it is capable\n>  of outputting several tons of weight out your fist.\n\nYou will also be able to purchase the weapons you designated, in your words, as \"must-have\" in the Shop.
