It's all gone now. I'm glad I was smarter than to assume I was going insane, though now I wonder what the other deceivers must have gone through.

The core of hell is still far yonder, but yet my body trembles in its sheer horror... Maybe I'll make it out alive if I'm lucky, but I should at least try.

The kernel and ROM etc. sources are all done dumping, the utilities are still going but those aren't important and have already been scanned for ASIC code.

Proc. analysis has been done on all of the dumped code, revealing many unoptimized code paths, ASIC crap, and a few red herrings. Not careful enough for technology that could easily exist two years after this was developed.
