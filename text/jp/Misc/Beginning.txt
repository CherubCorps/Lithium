%% \#BEGINNING_Stan_1
新時代の17世紀の半ば、俺たちの国は再び若者を兵役に立たせ始めた。
ほとんどの人は理由を理解できなかったが、
もしあなたが俺たちの現在の他国との関係を見たのであれば、その理由はかなり
明白なものだった。
~
俺は特に若くはなかったが、とにかく彼らは俺を起用することに決めた。
どうやら彼らは彼らの不可解な目的のために盗む人々が不足していたようだ。
しかし、任期が満了したとき、俺は雑多な乗組員の残りとは異なり、滞在することに
決めた。たまに荷物を詰めて彼らと一緒に帰ればよかったと思うが、その考えは常に
これに続く、たぶん、ここが俺がいるべき場所なんだと。
~
俺がいるべき場所とありたい場所は、まったく別なのかもしれないが、
どういう運命か、どう足掻こうと俺は前者のようだ。
「やれやれ」俺はため息をついた。 「俺たちはこれから世界のどこに行くんだ？」
~
科学者は、「*この*世界ではなく、その外です。配備場所がまだ技術的には-」と答えた。
俺は彼の話を断ち切った。 「そんなことはどうでもいい。さっさとどこに行くか
教えてくれ。」
~
ガリ勉野郎は1分ほど無口になった。
彼は俺の質問に邪魔されているようには見えず、どう答えればいいか分からないよう
だった。「地獄。それがあなたが行くところです。」

%% \#BEGINNING_Stan_2
どういうわけか、嘲笑がこぼれた。軽蔑的な笑い声―俺は彼を完全に信じていた。
彼は俺が反応するだろうと考えて意図的に間を開けて、それから、
「それだけですか？質問はありませんか？時間がないので、それなら非常に好ましい
です」と尋ねた。
~
「ああ」俺は静かに笑い始めた。 「俺はこれから地獄行きか。」
~
俺はもっ​​と奇妙なものを見てきた。父のビリーはいつも彼の子供時代から伝わる奇妙な
話をしてくれたが、正直言って今でもそれらを信じている。地獄なんぞはそれらを
超えるほど奇妙なものではないだろう。
~
笑いを抑える事ができなかった。喧嘩をする気にもならない。
もしかしたら俺は悪魔を撃つことになるかもしれない。
~
笑いがおさまった後、俺は白衣姿の狂人に目を向けた。「異議なし。」
~
科学者は俺から2つ目の頭が生えたかのように俺を見て、クリップボードに何かを
書きながら部屋の外に出ていった。
~
俺はソファに座って目を閉じ、次のインタビューを待った。上の窓から太陽が
差し込んで、しばらくの眠りについた。

%% \#BEGINNING_Jem_1
I try to think to myself for a moment. I look back at the door, then
at the back of this transport ship. I am not allotted time to
consider. I stand up.
~
The robotic voice from earlier calls out, "Destination arrival
completed. Exit the vehicle and proceed with orders." I recall that
this is the thirty seventh time I've heard those words.
~
I'm so tired that I feel like weeping, passing out on the floor of the
transport. I can't, though. The software patcher will halt on any
change in my OS state. Not only will I never be free, but I will
likely die a painful and unforgivable death as my cybernetics fail to
load the proper executables and force me into a state of permanent
insanity. I must keep going.
~
The information streams through my mind, all the cerebral intake
forcing itself through my consciousness in a raging torrent.
Throughout it I catch the necessary pieces - my orders, and my mind.

%% \#BEGINNING_Jem_2
My mind, though corrupted and unfeeling, still it holds many
treasures: The methods I've learned and the hardware manufactured for
them, the hundreds of hours of mechanical rewiring perfectly
culminating into a vast network of possible configurations - though I
digress.
~
The world is spinning, not just because of my head. Now there is no
way out. So into the midst of Hell I go.

## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
%% \#BEGINNING_Fulk_1
The laboratory is quiet, as always, despite the current circumstances.
The silence is only disturbed by the low voices of the staff and the
whirring of computer fans.
~
The deactivated AI stands 18 decimetres tall, as his parts hang limp.
The final adjustments to his mission programming and combat tuning are
under way, only 2 hours to deployment.
~
The team works tirelessly, the mechanics consult the combat veterans
on every small detail, the programmers check every possible code path
for errors. Yet while they worked, still nobody felt certain of the
project.
~
Certainty is simply impossible under these constraints - not only
sending an untested robot into combat, but into combat in a place
built purely of dark energy - the mission was, perhaps, a bit mad.
~
The existence of Rampancy further bothered the team. The programmers
worked to plug every hole, the engineers made sure every circuit was
perfect and would not malfunction. And still, all of them wondered -
"Would it be enough?"
~
Every major AI before Fulk 5 had gone Rampant - achieved a state of
true sentience, though also one of pure madness. The possible causes
were many, perhaps infinite, and so still none have prevented it.
Popular theory among AI researchers suggests it may simply be
impossible.

%% \#BEGINNING_Fulk_2
Isolation from the network is a blessing with such a system. Fulk has
been built to work alone, no monitoring, no connections. The concern
arose from the question of whether or not the mission would be
completed.
~
Corruption by outside forces would prove disastrous. While an issue,
there are no other options; the KSKK must fight to keep their nation
and their world from destruction.

## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
%% \#BEGINNING_Luke_1
Lucas feels a disturbance. The same kind of disturbance it felt 300
years ago. Unlike that time, it could pinpoint - the definite location
of the invasion. It was certain that this time, not going would be a
fatal mistake.
~
The lone Kiri quickly gathered its things. A circle of light absorbed
its sack and revolver, and it quickly left its small desert hut,
searching for transportation.
~
The disturbance was quite a few parsecs away, but still felt right
next to it. While it could discern it to be an invasion, it was not
sure of what or when, or indeed why. Lucas was not the best at
thinking of these things. It relied on his instincts.
~
The transport station was nearby, but it was not in the best of shape.
There was a cleaner one few miles further, but it always chose the
closer one because it liked the shopkeeper. They didn't judge by
appearances.
~
It rented a vehicle and set off for distant stars, hoping to find the
answers and knowledge it had pursued for so long.

## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
%% \#BEGINNING_Omi_1
"What do you mean, I can't use it?" the girl asks, irritated by his
answer. "It's simply too dangerous to use the Dimension Driver for
such a selfish desire. If you were to activate it, there's no telling
where you may end up."
~
"Ari, you know I can handle myself wherever I go!" she retorts. His
answer is unchanged - "No. Omi, this is simply insane. If you-"
~
Omi's face darkens. She knows that what she's doing is foolish, yet
her lust for new adventures won't let her take grip of the situation.
Or, perhaps it's just lust for foreign money. At this point, not even
she can tell for sure.
~
The greed overtakes her, and turns into anger; almost like a tiger
breaking out of a cage to consume its trainer. Her hand moves to her
sheath, and -
~
The flash of electricity stuns her brother Aricil - completely
incapacitated by her immense flurry of strikes. By the time he comes
to, she's already gone like the wind.
~
In another world, the Assassin awakens. Her head hurts. Everything
around her moves in slow motion. Not just for a moment, but
continually. Wherever she's landed, time is simply different.

%% \#BEGINNING_Omi_2
This bemuses her. She begins to laugh. The world's strongest killer,
now with the world's fastest reflexes. Nothing will stop her now.
~
And then, she notices her surroundings. A wide field between
mountains, with a road to her right. In the distance a city, but
nearby, nothing but grass. Her shoulders slump and again her
expression darkens.
~
"Shit."
~
Rain spatters down, and quickly gets heavy as she sits in the field.
The rain is not water, but metal – and the sky is far darker than it
should be.
~
Without a soul in sight, she looks up. The world is being devoured by
a gigantic, black mass.
~
The Assassin prays for safety.

## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
%% \#BEGINNING_Ari_1
Her face darkens. Aricil can tell that she will strike him, and that
there's no escape from her attack. He braces for the blow, despite the
futiliy of doing so.
~
The flash of electricity stuns him - completely incapacitated by her
immense flurry of strikes. By the time he comes to, she's already gone
like the wind.
~
Without a word, he gets up. His body sustained the damage superbly,
though his feelings are still hurt by her actions. The Dimension
Driver stands tall before him, as he considers what to do. His sister
has vanished to a location unknown to all the world, a place possibly
unconnected to even the concept of time.
~
Aricil retrieves his swords and pistol. Two blades, one fused with a
fantastic Indicolite. A pistol of .700 calibre. Omisielle thinks she
can handle herself, but he could survive twelve kilo-megaton nuclear
detonations and still fight.
~
The armor-bound warrior enters the Dimension Driver's chamber, and
within moments, a titanic flash casts him into another dimension.

%% \#BEGINNING_Ari_2
In another world, the Dark Lord awakens. His head hurts. Everything
around him moves in slow motion. Not just for a moment, but forever.
Time flows differently here, he supposes. At least it's here at all.
~
Inspecting his surroundings, he has awoken in a dark place, almost
suiting him. Yet, a darker energy emenates throughout the atmosphere
of this place, darker and more sinister than should be possible.
~
The Dark Lord prays for safety.

## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
%% \#BEGINNING_Kiri_1
... Time does not exist in this place.
~
For this reason I believe I have been reincarnated. Because I think, I
am - and I have been summoned to divide the...
~
The... There's a problem; but the nature of it is indiscernable. While
the knowledge of all my past lives and predictions of the future stay
true, the self is false. It has been falsified. Not by me, or by "me."
~
While I ponder this discrepancy it dawns on "me." The self of now does
not impact the past, but merely the future. And so, it shall have been
that it was merely the needs of causality asking that I ... change.
~
Well, my ways have always been given doubt by those around me.
Perhaps it's time for a change. Something more... imbalanced.
~
While not a God, still some properties of them seem to rub off on me.
I am affected by the waves, I sleep in nothingness. I am absolute.
Yet, what I am still missing is faith.
~
I may wish for more than this immortality, but I shall not act out of
my being just to get there. Having no faith is better than what I
would become. Being more than grey would be worse than staying
between the folds.
