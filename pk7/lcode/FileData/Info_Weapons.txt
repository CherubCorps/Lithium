This rather oddly shaped submachine gun was mass-produced by Omakeda during
their earlier years, when they were still getting their designs down. While
the gun has overheating issues, it mitigates this by allowing the user to feed
coolant tubes directly into it, and counter-balances the issue by having both
great fire-rate and great over-all projectile damage.

The weapon fires modified high velocity, armor piercing, vacuum enabled
5.7x28mm bullets, manufactured by various nameless companies, and loads

The rifle uses a relatively complex loading mechanism for the safety of the
user; one must first release the bolt with a safety guard near the trigger
mechanism, open the bolt, wait for a round to cycle and close it.

This is in part required due to the immense heat that would be caused by
opening the weapon prematurely after firing, and the complexity that would be
needed to have a fully automatic round cycling system.

The weapon's inner workings still elude many, but what is known is that it
condenses demonic energy far more than any other known artifact; the weapon
then takes this hyper-condensed energy and emits it into a very small,
circular disc buffer on the top of the weapon.
