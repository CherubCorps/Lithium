# Overview

A mod in which you shoot things until they die. See the ZDoom forums thread linked above for more details.

# Running

If you wish to run an in-development version of the mod, you can click the "Clone or download" button and then "Download ZIP".

Once you've done that you can then load the `pk7` folder into ZDoom as you would any other mod.

# Code

The code in Lithium is half C and half DECORATE. The C code is compiled to ACS bytecode with [GDCC](https://github.com/DavidPH/GDCC), an awesome compiler made by a crazy compiler man.

The C code is rather terse at times, and scarcely commented, but hopefully it should be understandable enough.

I tend to use a lot of GDCC's C extensions, so some of the code may be a bit confusing for purists.
