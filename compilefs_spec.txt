The compilefs language is extremely simple, it was created to allow basic text
to be outputted into a code file, specifically LANGUAGE.

Any line not detected to be a command of any kind will be completely ignored.

Toplevel commands include:
<in directory> directoryname
   Sets the directory to put outputted files into. Defaults to ".".

<in file> filename
   Begins a block (terminated by <done>) which will output the result of each
   data command into the given file.

Data commands output processed data to the current file.
"put" commands use the syntax "arg -> alias" to denote the alias to output.

Data commands include:
<comment:>
   Outputs the argument as a comment.

<put data:>
   Outputs the argument to the given alias.

<put file:>
   Outputs the contents of a file to the given alias.

<parse file:>
   Parses the given file using parsefile syntax.

"parsefiles" are another format provided by compilefs, created to make large
amounts of multi-line data easier to write. It provides five commands, which
all output data:

<##>
   Outputs a comment.

<++>
   Outputs an entire file to the given alias using the syntax "alias | file".

<==>
   Outputs to the given alias using the syntax "alias | arg".

<%%>
   Outputs the following lines to the given alias verbatim.

<@@>
   Outputs the following lines to the given alias, concatenating lines that
   are not empty together with spaces, and separating lines with an empty one.
