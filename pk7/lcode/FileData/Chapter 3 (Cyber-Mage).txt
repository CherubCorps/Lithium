I've entered a strange realm that doesn't seem to make sense. This must really be Hell itself; no mistaking it now.

The air is so humid and hot that I've begun sweating. That can't happen. I can't sweat. There isn't anything to sweat. I'm scared. This has to be an illusion... or does reality not matter in this place?

In any case, now that I'm here, there's no turning back. I have to destroy whatever corrupted them, I'm sure they're here... I saw it in their eyes, they were yelling at me visions of their true selves that could not be described with human eyes. That only I could know.

Though my mind had just been regained, now sanity may lie out of my hands.

It doesn't matter. I will see this through.
