Hello, it has been forwarded to me that your Computer/Brain Interface hardware was not properly upgraded for this mission. I've had several communications errors with your secondary employers, and it is truly starting to get annoying.

Due to failure to communicate with OFMD, I've taken it upon myself to send your hardware upgrades through several proxy agents.

They may all be dead now. I have no idea, really. Hopefully you will survive whatever they didn't. Anyways, as for the important part of this message, here is a list of all the hardware that has been sent:

Two CPU/RAM upgrade packages. The first one is a powerful BC-0265 processor and 500TiB of RAM. Unfortunately, something horrible appears to have happened to the agent carrying it, and so a secondary package has been sent, containing temporary replacements: a Z6808 and 100TiB of RAM.

One Armor Interface. A PCB and a set of emplacements on your armor.

One Weapon Modification Device, as its name implies.

One Weapon Refactoring Device, which can perform large modifications on guns.

See you.
