@@ \#ENDING_SpiderDemon_Stan
The massive spider demon explodes into a million bits as your body is
once again shuttled through dimensions of space-time.

As you travel to the next plane, your mind feels like it too is being
spread infinitely. You think of a hundred things at once.

A lot of them are starting to seem like sad thoughts.

Why did you get chosen?

Is there really a threat, or am I just fighting such a long and
horrendeous war against nothing?

Did any of the demons really exaggerate?

These thoughts all seem to fly away as you are returned to the
corporeal world.

You seem to be on some kind of twisted version of Earth...
