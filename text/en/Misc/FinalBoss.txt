## Icon of Sin / Stan --------------------------------------------------------|
%% \#BOSS_IOS_1_Stan
You have come to my lair?
A pity. You're a powerful one.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_2_Stan
While I'm impressed at your gall, and your ability to kill that which is mine,

%% \#BOSS_IOS_3_Stan
I have no need for someone who dares to try and destroy me.
You're useless.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_4_Stan
Why do you think they sent you of all people on this mission?
Why do you think they chose to disband you?

%% \#BOSS_IOS_5_Stan
Think about it.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_6_Stan
One who doesn't even think highly of himself, can't bring himself to kill on orders.
Can't even pull the trigger without hesistation.
Can't even see the glory in killing for sport.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_7_Stan
You should never have thought that someone had "realized your potential."
Now you're here. You fucking idiot.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_8_Stan
What kind of utter moron even takes a suicide mission?
Oh, I know.
Ha ha.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_9_Stan
You should kill yourself now.
It will be less painful than what I will do to you.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_10_Stan
Maybe your brute strength will be useful to me, even if I have to chain you down to use it.
I can keep you alive as long as I want.

## Icon of Sin / Jem ---------------------------------------------------------|
%% \#BOSS_IOS_1_Jem
You fucking scum.
You are not worthy of being here.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_2_Jem
My defeat is impossible from the likes of you.
If you had the slightest microcosm of humanity left in you, maybe you wouldn't be so fucking pathetic.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_3_Jem
This is the end.
You will not see your friends in the afterlife.
This realm already consumed them.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_4_Jem
What a disgusting pile of flesh, not even in its original form, like the Gods should have intended.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_5_Jem
They're idiots. They shouldn't even be considered Gods when they can't create a species incapable of subservience.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_6_Jem
As for you, I think you're much the same.
So much deception.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_7_Jem
You defy your masters,
you defy your humanity,
you defy your very body.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_8_Jem
Stupid girl. Do you think those modifications could possibly trick me?
Even if they could, I know your origins. You come from Delsona.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_9_Jem
It's too bad you couldn't save any of those who were captured.
Your society is fucking laughable.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_10_Jem
A bunch of idiotic sheep waiting to be herded.
I think I've had my fun now.
I won't bother assimilating you.
\cgYou\c- will simply fade into nonexistence.
