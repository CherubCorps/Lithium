   "\n"
   "Besides being deployed with your pistol and combat knife (as you requested),\n"
   "you have been sent these five weapons:\n"
   "\n"
   "1. A combat-modified military model Hiku Mk.2 Shotgun, manufactured by Omakeda.\n"
   ">  This weapon was chosen because it has a powerful plasma shot that can\n"
   ">  penetrate the demons' armour.  Besides this, it has low recoil and an easy\n"
   ">  to handle pump-action loading system.  It has hopefully been deployed to\n"
   ">  the most convenient location you shall come across.\n"
   "\n"
   "2. An AllPoint 75-b Assault Rifle.\n"
   ">  You shall be fighting hordes of lower ranking demons and un-dead which are\n"
   ">  quite vulnerable to small arms fire and explosives, so naturally this gun\n"
   ">  was our first choice.  Equipped with a box magazine and inbuilt grenade\n"
   ">  launcher, capable of eliminating most lower tier threats.\n"
   "\n"
   "3. A Grenade Launcher, manufactured by Sym 4.3.\n"
   ">  With this, you can completely obliterate larger targets and crowds of\n"
   ">  demons.  Unfortunately, due to its weight, we were not able to get it in\n"
   ">  any convenient location.\n"
   "\n"
   "4. An AllPoint 68-n Plasma Rifle.\n"
   ">  This weapon does extreme damage to anything living, but some of the tougher\n"
   ">  demons seem to mitigate its damage.  Regardless, it has been sent to you\n"
   ">  because it can shred through demons with high rank.\n"
   "\n"
   "5. The Omega Cannon.\n"
   ">  I myself am not sure why high order would bother giving you such an\n"
   ">  expensive and dangerous piece of equipment, but you must have been sent\n"
   ">  this artifact for the purpose of destroying *something*.\n"
   "\n"
   "6. A KSKK Utsu-denka-sou assault bracelet.\n"
   ">  A weapon that may prove useful against weak and strong enemies alike, it's\n"
   ">  been sent to an unknown location, unfortunately. Don't be tricked by the\n"
   ">  appearance of it. Even if it just looks like a fancy bracelet, it is capable\n"
   ">  of outputting several tons of weight out your fist.\n"
   "\n"
   "You will also be able to purchase the weapons you designated, in your words,\n"
   "as \"must-have\" in the Shop.  I warn you that these weapons may not be as\n"
   "effective as you think; we spent quite a lot of time making sure that the\n"
   "arms we sent you were top-notch.\n"
