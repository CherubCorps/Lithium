Originally a vanilla mod Ka Haa'umi pistol manufactured by Omakeda, this gun
has been repaired enough times that it's practically indestructible now.

Having used it for a whole decade, this pistol still services you today,
without fail.

Fires fourteen custom high-grade vacuum-enabled .374 Express rounds. Can be
reloaded easily, since you duct-taped a magazine holder on the side. Features
a small CB-Scope similar to that of most other Omakeda weapons.

Manufactured by Omakeda, this shotgun fires both regular 8-gauge buck and a
small plasma charge at the same time. This enables the shotgun to be used both
as a rifle with railgun-like capabilities and a standard shotgun.

The plasma charge is powered by a small self-replenishing battery lodged in
the firing mechanism.

Most military models come with a CB-Scope.

1401 NE, A.O.F Inc. ran a line of modified Hiku Mk.2 shotguns that removed the
shell firing mechanism and replaced it with a high-power photon condenser.

This both removes the need to chamber rounds and gives a nice boost in fire

A modification for the Hiku Mk.1 shotgun made by A.O.F Inc. for research
purposes. Uses a rather small container of poison that refills itself
automatically, contained in the loading mechanism, to infect enemies with
deadly corrosive acid fused with deadly neurotoxin.

This rather terrifying upgrade was never updated to the Mk.2 model. The
internal structure is similar enough that one may still use it with the Mk.2,
but the plasma firing mechanism must be disabled.

Puts out 2x2 4ga shells made to hunt the gigantic beasts of the planet Ch'ari.

The barrels are extremely tempered so as to not melt under harsh environments,
and have a unique dual-loading system. This dual-loading system allows you to
fire four shots in rapid succession without a large amount of recoil by
placing additional shells into both barrels.

It is currently unknown how this actually works, and it possibly uses
4-dimensional geometry.

Boasting extreme speed, highly modifiable parts, and a sleek exterior design,
the D.671 will eradicate any foe you put against it.

After SYM4.3 put it on the market, this weapon was ultimately ignored because
of lack of advertising and early rumors regarding how weakly rockets are
initially propelled out the rifle.

This seems to use nanomachines or some similar technology to propel rockets
after they've been ignited and left the barrel; thus causing a small lag
before the rocket takes off fully.

Eight high-yield rocket-propelled grenades are loaded one at a time into the

The secondary trigger can be held to select the mode of fire -- the default
mode shoots all eight in a horizontal line forward. The second mode shoots the
rockets in a spiral pattern for maximum damage on one area, and the third and
final mode hurls all of the grenades out of their rocket casings.

through the ion ray all at once, creating a huge plasmatic explosion in a very

and wanted whoever attained it to be all-powerful.
