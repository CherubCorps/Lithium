\cgWhat a riot!
\cyA human comes to our domain.

%% \#BOSS_BAR_2_Stan
\cgIt's quite amusing to see someone so strong of will here.
\cyDon't fret though. It'll be over quite soon.

%% \#BOSS_BAR_3_Stan
\cgAn incredible sight seeing a warrior here.
\cyThis place is cursed. If you leave, it will only be worse.

%% \#BOSS_BAR_4_Stan
\cgYou won't be allowed to pass. Deimos is...
\cyDeimos is ours now. I think it's only fair to tell you.

%% \#BOSS_BAR_5_Stan
\cgSomeone so ready to die must be prepared for hard knowledge.
\cyApologies for being harsh, but we have already won.

%% \#BOSS_BAR_6_Stan
\ctYour universe is forfeit.

%% \#BOSS_BAR_7_Stan
\cgIt won't be long now until our masters' plans are in full force.
\cyIt will be too late by the time you get through the gate.

%% \#BOSS_BAR_8_Stan
\cgYour species is doomed. But we will grant you one last fight.
\cyBesides, you wouldn't be nearly enough to stop them.

%% \#BOSS_BAR_9_Stan
\cgIf you wish to leave, we cannot grant that.
\cyIf you go through, you will only see despair.

@@ \#BOSS_BAR_10_Stan
\ctPrepare for your last breath.

What? A human has ascended the tower?

Astonishing!

@@ \#BOSS_CYB_2_Stan
I see by now you know how this will go.

If you're ready then come at me.

@@ \#BOSS_CYB_3_Stan
I look down on you and see something greater than what you really are.

I see the crazed eyes of a demon.

@@ \#BOSS_CYB_4_Stan
If you were pure with our blood, you would be renouned as one of our
greatest warriors.

But I merely jest.

@@ \#BOSS_CYB_5_Stan
No being that fails like yours to realize the absolute glory of the
kill, genocide of the inferior, could ever be worthy of being one of
us.

@@ \#BOSS_CYB_6_Stan
To kill indiscriminately the degenerate races that threaten our
growth.

Disgusting.

@@ \#BOSS_CYB_7_Stan
A human becoming something like me is but an absurd fantasy.

@@ \#BOSS_CYB_8_Stan
I've seen few who have come to this tower with such conviction. Most
of them were killed simply by the power of my barrier, or sheer
terror.

@@ \#BOSS_CYB_9_Stan
You deserve, of all humans, a death less wanton than that.

I will fight you with all of my strength.

@@ \#BOSS_CYB_10_Stan
You certainly seem to be in such a state where you can't think of
anything but killing anyhow. Like a real demon. Heh heh.

Prepare yourself.

@@ \#BOSS_SPD_1_Stan
You have come to my lair?

A pity. You're a powerful one.

@@ \#BOSS_SPD_2_Stan
If you had simply surrendered to my subordinates, this would be much,
much easier.

@@ \#BOSS_SPD_3_Stan
At this point all I can do for you is give you one piece of advice.

@@ \#BOSS_SPD_4_Stan
If you really want to see what's on the other side of my portal, be
prepared for disappointment.

@@ \#BOSS_SPD_5_Stan
The Nobles did not exaggerate.

While they have slick tongues in the courts of our land, they never
lie to humans.

@@ \#BOSS_SPD_6_Stan
Not that it would do them any good. You intrepid beasts will just
shoot anything that looks scary to you.

@@ \#BOSS_SPD_7_Stan
We will never empathize with your kind. If we are to successfully live
on, all of you must die.

@@ \#BOSS_SPD_8_Stan
It's you or us.

We expand. You extinguish.

@@ \#BOSS_SPD_8_Stan
You're honestly not worth my time. If anything I shouldn't even be
talking to you.

But I want to let it seep into you. Your race will perish under our
hand. There is no need for undercode here. It has already begun and
you can not stop it.

@@ \#BOSS_SPD_9_Stan
Once we're done with you, what next, you say?

We find a new enemy.

@@ \#BOSS_SPD_10_Stan
You will not be the last.

As for yourself, I will keep you as a pet. Laughable and disgusting as
you are.

@@ \#BOSS_IOS_1_Stan
I think it's about time I ended this already.

@@ \#BOSS_IOS_2_Stan
While I find myself impressed by your ability to kill that which is
mine, I have no need for someone who dares to try and destroy me.

@@ \#BOSS_IOS_3_Stan
You're useless.

It's utterly baffling my spawn saw anything in such an idiotic,
flaccid worm.

@@ \#BOSS_IOS_4_Stan
Why do you think they sent you of all people on this mission? Why do
you think they chose to disband you?

@@ \#BOSS_IOS_5_Stan
Think about it.

@@ \#BOSS_IOS_6_Stan
One who doesn't even think highly of himself, can't bring himself to
kill on orders.

Can't even pull the trigger without hesitation.

Can't even see the glory in killing for sport.

@@ \#BOSS_IOS_7_Stan
You should never have thought that someone had "realized your
potential." Now you're here. You fucking idiot.

@@ \#BOSS_IOS_8_Stan
What kind of utter moron even takes a suicide mission?

Oh, I know.

Ha ha.

@@ \#BOSS_IOS_9_Stan
You should kill yourself now.

It will be less painful than what I will do to you.

@@ \#BOSS_IOS_10_Stan
Maybe your brute strength will be useful to me, even if I have to
chain you down to use it.

I can keep you alive as long as I want.
