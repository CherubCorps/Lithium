@@ LITH_INFO_DESCR_Mateba
A re-creation of the classic Mateba Model 6 Unica revolver, which was rather
popular a few thousand years ago from its (at the time) unique design and
style.

This version is suited for a left-handed user, with a barrel that opens to the
right. The weapon loads twelve .454 Casull rounds, six in a cylinder and six in
a magazine in the grip. The weapon fires every other round out of the magazine
through the ejection port, and the rest are kept in the cylinder.

Due to the original design being lost in time, this revolver sports several
accuracy deficiencies, but nonetheless has the classic look and feel of the
original gun. Produced by A.O.F Inc. for knight-class units.

The 19th method of the \cgRussum\c- mode, Finirentur, known as the Finalizer,
is a very powerful red magic that creates a sigil in front of the user which
then fires out a projectile at fairly high speed. This projectile is capable
of instantly deceasing any mid-heavily wounded, living being.

The Mateba R119 Finalizer channeler is capable of firing this intense magic,
however it is limited to the last shot of the cylinder so as to not
potentially overload the user. While this modification was created by A.O.F
Inc, the Finirentur method was created recently by mages of Neptune 11 in
Algidistari.

This weapon is a modification of a rifle made on Ch'ari, a memento your friend
gave to you to ravage for parts. The magazine has been moved from the bottom
(which is now an ejection port) to the back, where it's convenient to reload.

This placement also allows for the bullets to be electrified with several
hundred volts before leaving the barrel, causing anything that gets hit by it
to be electrocuted harshly, hence your name for it: the "Shock Rifle."

While the weapon only has a 7-round magazine, it fires extremely deadly
7.62x54mmR cartridges with almost pinpoint accuracy, thanks to being extremely
well-manufactured, likely under the care of a very skilled Kiri craftsman.

This rather oddly shaped submachine gun was mass-produced by Omakeda during
their earlier years, when they were still getting their designs down. While
the gun has overheating issues, it mitigates this by allowing the user to feed
coolant tubes directly into it, and counter-balances the issue by having both
great fire-rate and great over-all projectile damage.

The weapon fires modified high velocity, armor piercing, vacuum enabled
5.7x28mm bullets, manufactured by various nameless companies, and loads
bullpup. It has since been re-branded by SYM4.3, who now produce it for
Omakeda with royalties.

This magic buffer is unfortunately unstable, as it has to be recreated every

suddenly and cause the buffer to rip. If this did occur, the weapon would
displode, and bullets would fly out constantly.

Produced by KSKK under the pseudonym "Kazami Defense Arms" (for various legal

through just about any being with flesh until resulting in a violent,
explosive impact.

The rifle uses a relatively complex loading mechanism for the safety of the
user; one must first release the bolt with a safety guard near the trigger
mechanism, open the bolt, wait for a round to cycle and close it.

This is in part required due to the immense heat that would be caused by
opening the weapon prematurely after firing, and the complexity that would be
needed to have a fully automatic round cycling system.

An atrocious weapon supposedly made from the life research of seven magi of
Hell, the Star Destroyer was made with the sole purpose of destroying whatever
created it so hard that it would never, ever come back again.

The weapon's inner workings still elude many, but what is known is that it
condenses demonic energy far more than any other known artifact; the weapon
then takes this hyper-condensed energy and emits it into a very small,
circular disc buffer on the top of the weapon.

The resulting projectile grows in size as it disperses energy in front of it,
causing hundreds of smaller projectiles to come out as it rips through
anything in its path.
