Your final payment was a grand 1 trillion Score.

The effort you went through almost seems worth it now, but
still in your mind lingers memories of horrors no man
should know.

In the end, the corporation you worked with merged with
a new company, the UAC, and you never heard from them again.

If what you saw was real...
...Maybe it's best nobody knows you're a hero.
