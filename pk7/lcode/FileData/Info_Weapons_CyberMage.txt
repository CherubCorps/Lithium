@@ LITH_TXT_INFO_DESCR_Mateba
A re-creation of the classic Mateba Model 6 Unica revolver, which was rather
popular a few thousand years ago from its (at the time) unique design and
style.

This version is suited for a left-handed user, with a barrel that opens to the
right. The weapon loads twelve .454 Casull rounds much like the Mateba Grifone
variant.

Due to the original design being lost in time, this revolver sports several
accuracy deficiencies, but nonetheless has the classic look and feel of the
original gun. Produced by A.O.F Inc. for knight-class units.

@@ LITH_TXT_INFO_DESCR_MatebaUpgr
The 19th method of the \cgRussum\c- mode, Finirentur, known as the Finalizer,
is a very powerful red magic that creates a sigil infront of the user which
then fires out a projectile at fairly high speed. This projectile is capable
of instantly deceasing any mid-heavily wounded, living being.

The Mateba R119 Finalizer channeler is capable of firing this intense magic,
however it is limited to the last shot of the cylinder so as to not
potentially overload the user. While this modification was created by A.O.F
Inc, the Finirentur method was created recently by mages of Neptune 11 in
Algidistari.

@@ LITH_TXT_INFO_DESCR_SPAS
The first (and currently only) shotgun produced by Newvec corp, an extended
production line was fulfilled by contract from A.O.F Inc. for knight-class
units thanks to the overwhelming fire-power and cheapness of this weapon.

It fires any standard high-potency 12-gauge shell, and loads 5 shots. The
design is extremely simple, but it does not overheat or jam often, is cheap to
produce, and is very, very powerful.

@@ LITH_TXT_INFO_DESCR_SPASUpg2
An upgrade for the NV48 which uses a small magic buffer to automatically load
shells from a four-dimensional area. A rather simple, yet effective solution,
which also is used to accelerate shots slightly more, causing more damaging
projectiles.

Somehow, the accelerated shots also seem to blend into eachother slightly.

The weapon must be fired a bit slower (and is forced to) due to the violent
nature of the magic being used, and the added recoil.

@@ LITH_TXT_INFO_DESCR_SMG
This rather oddly shaped submachine gun was mass-produced by Omakeda during
their earlier years, when they were still getting their designs down. While
the gun has overheating issues, it mitigates this by allowing the user to feed
coolant tubes directly into it, and counter-balances the issue by having both
great fire-rate and great over-all projectile damage.

The weapon fires modified high velocity, armor piercing, vacuum enabled
5.7x28mm bullets, manufactured by various nameless companies, and loads
bullpup. It has since been re-branded by SYM4.3, who now produce it for
Omakeda with royalties.

@@ LITH_TXT_INFO_DESCR_SMGUpgr
The AA/F474 is an extension to the SYM4.3 D.22 MODEL M SUBMACHINE GUN which
attaches a magic buffer into the magazine upon insertion, causing it to
over-load another two magazines worth of ammunition while firing.

This magic buffer is unfortunately unstable, as it has to be recreated every
load, and so care must be taken while reloading the gun to not move too
suddenly and cause the buffer to rip. If this did occur, the weapon would
displode, and bullets would fly out constantly.

Complaints from users of the Model M SMG were not many for SYM4.3, however they
were actually the most abundant of complaints the company had ever received.

In the interest of their public face, they convinced the company producing the
gun to make a replacement for the hammer that could detect the heat of the
barrel and stop firing until it has sufficiently cooled down.

@@ LITH_TXT_INFO_DESCR_IonRifle
Produced by KSKK under the pseudonym "Kazami Defense Arms" (for various legal
reasons.) Fires volatile ions at railgun speeds, which go straight
through just about any being with flesh until resulting in a violent,
explosive impact.

The rifle uses a relatively complex loading mechanism for the safety of the
user; one must first release the bolt with a safety guard near the trigger
mechanism, open the bolt, wait for a round to cycle and close it.

This is in part required due to the immense heat that would be caused by
opening the weapon prematurely after firing, and the complexity that would be
needed to have a fully automatic round cycling system.

@@ LITH_TXT_INFO_DESCR_StarDestroyer
An atrocious weapon supposedly made from the life research of seven mages of
Hell, the Star Destroyer was made with the sole purpose of destroying whatever
created it so hard that it would never, ever come back again.

The weapon's inner workings still elude many, but what is known is that it
condenses demonic energy far more than any other known artifact; the weapon
then takes this hyper-condensed energy and emits it into a very small,
circular disc buffer on the top of the weapon.

The resulting projectile grows in size as it disperses energy in front of it,
causing hundreds of smaller projectiles to come out as it rips through
anything in its path.

The 24th method of the \ciAurantia\c- mode, a rather basic attack which fires
sixteen orange dots in a sequence from two sides, over two rows. The
simplicity of casting and ease of use makes this spell a rather common sight.

The design was created by first century mage Johnathon Booker and was later
further simplified by various spellcasters. Your version of it prefers a flat
shape rather than a curved one that most use.

destroy several micro-fighters and around 195 personnel aboard the enemy ship.
