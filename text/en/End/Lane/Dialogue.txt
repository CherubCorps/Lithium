\cgWhat a riot!
\cyA human comes to our domain.

%% \#BOSS_BAR_2_Lane
\cgIt's quite amusing to see someone so strong of will here.
\cyDon't fret though. It'll be over quite soon.

%% \#BOSS_BAR_3_Lane
\cgAn incredible sight seeing a warrior here.
\cyThis place is cursed. If you leave, it will only be worse.

%% \#BOSS_BAR_4_Lane
\cgYou won't be allowed to pass. Deimos is...
\cyDeimos is ours now. I think it's only fair to tell you.

%% \#BOSS_BAR_5_Lane
\cgSomeone so ready to die must be prepared for hard knowledge.
\cyApologies for being harsh, but we have already won.

%% \#BOSS_BAR_6_Lane
\ctYour universe is forfeit.

%% \#BOSS_BAR_7_Lane
\cgIt won't be long now until our masters' plans are in full force.
\cyIt will be too late by the time you get through the gate.

%% \#BOSS_BAR_8_Lane
\cgYour species is doomed. But we will grant you one last fight.
\cyBesides, you wouldn't be nearly enough to stop them.

%% \#BOSS_BAR_9_Lane
\cgIf you wish to leave, we cannot grant that.
\cyIf you go through, you will only see despair.

@@ \#BOSS_BAR_10_Lane
\ctPrepare for your last breath.

%% \#BOSS_CYB_1_Lane
What? A human has ascended the tower?

Astonishing!

%% \#BOSS_CYB_2_Lane
I see by now you know how this will go.

If you're ready, then come at me.

%% \#BOSS_CYB_3_Lane
I look down on you and see something greater than what you really are.

I see the crazed eyes of a demon.

%% \#BOSS_CYB_4_Lane
If you were pure with our blood,
you would be renowned as one of our
greatest warriors.

But I merely jest.

%% \#BOSS_CYB_5_Lane
No being that fails like yours
to realize the absolute glory of the kill,
genocide of the inferior,
could ever be worthy of being one of us.

%% \#BOSS_CYB_6_Lane
To kill indiscriminately the degenerate races
that threaten our growth.

Disgusting.

%% \#BOSS_CYB_7_Lane
A human becoming something like me is but an absurd fantasy.

%% \#BOSS_CYB_8_Lane
I've seen few who have come to this tower
with such conviction.

Most of them were killed simply by the power
of my barrier, or sheer terror.

%% \#BOSS_CYB_9_Lane
You deserve, of all humans,
a death less wanton than that.

I will fight you with all of my strength.

%% \#BOSS_CYB_10_Lane
You certainly seem to be in such a state
where you can't think of anything but killing,
anyhow. Like a real demon. Heh heh.

Prepare yourself.

## Spider-Demon ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╕
%% \#BOSS_SPI_1_Lane
You have come to my lair?

A pity. You're a powerful one.

%% \#BOSS_SPI_2_Lane
If you had simply surrendered to my subordinates,
this would be much, much easier.

%% \#BOSS_SPI_3_Lane
At this point all I can do for you is give you one piece of advice.

%% \#BOSS_SPI_4_Lane
If you really want to see what's on the other side
of my portal, be prepared for disappointment.

%% \#BOSS_SPI_5_Lane
The Nobles did not exaggerate.

While they have slick tongues in the courts
of our land, they never lie to humans.

%% \#BOSS_SPI_6_Lane
Not that it would do them any good.
You intrepid beasts will just
shoot anything that looks scary to you.

%% \#BOSS_SPI_7_Lane
We will never empathize with your kind.
If we are to successfully live on,
all of you must die.

%% \#BOSS_SPI_8_Lane
It's you or us.

We expand. You extinguish.

%% \#BOSS_SPI_9_Lane
You're honestly not worth my time.
If anything, I shouldn't even be talking to you.

But I want to let it seep into you.
Your race will perish under our hand.
There is no need for undercode here.
It has already begun and you can not stop it.

%% \#BOSS_SPI_9_Lane
Once we're done with you, what next, you say?

We find a new enemy.

%% \#BOSS_SPI_10_Lane
You will not be the last.

As for yourself, I will keep you as a pet.
Laughable and disgusting as you are.

## Icon of Sin ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╕
%% \#BOSS_IOS_1_Lane
I think it's about time I ended this already.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_2_Lane
While I find myself impressed by your ability to kill
that which is mine, I have no need for someone
who dares to try and destroy me.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_3_Lane
You're useless.

It's utterly baffling my spawn saw anything
in such an idiotic, flaccid worm.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_4_Lane
Why do you think they sent you of all people
on this mission? Why do you think they chose to disband you?

%% \#BOSS_IOS_5_Lane
Think about it.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_6_Lane
One who doesn't even think highly of himself,
can't bring himself to kill on orders.

Can't even pull the trigger without hesitation.

Can't even see the glory in killing for sport.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_7_Lane
You should never have thought that someone had
"realized your potential."
Now you're here.
You fucking idiot.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_8_Lane
What kind of utter moron even takes a suicide mission?

Oh, I know.

Ha ha.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_9_Lane
You should kill yourself now.

It will be less painful than what I will do to you.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_10_Lane
Maybe your brute strength will be useful to me,
even if I have to chain you down to use it.

I can keep you alive as long as I want.
