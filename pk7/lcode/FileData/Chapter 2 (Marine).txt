There has been a change of plans going down the whole chain of command.
Your status as a military operative is now cancelled, and you are to enter a full-on suicide mission funded by OFMD alone.

There is an artifact nearby that we have sent you.  Once it is in your possession, immediately destroy it, and you will be transported to a city somewhere in Hell.  Command will await afterwards.

Lambert out.
