I will walk, with my shadow flag...

Oh, hello there. Apologies!

%% TITLEMAP_lane_begin_o0
Hello.
\cq[Who is this..?]

%% TITLEMAP_lane_begin_o0c
Ah, hey there.
\cq[She looks cute. She reminds me of Daniel.]

%% TITLEMAP_lane_begin_1m
Ah, hey there. You look familiar.
\cq[Who is she?]

%% TITLEMAP_lane_begin_2
Oh, sorry, didn't mean to bother you.
\cq[Back out while you can.]

%% TITLEMAP_lane_begin_3
Oh, sorry, didn't mean to bother you.
\cq[Back out.]

@@ TITLEMAP_lane_m_meet_0
Oh, do I? How so, might I ask? I don't believe I've met you before.

\cn[I feel intimidated by this doll.]

%% TITLEMAP_lane_m_meet_1
No, it must be nothing.
\ct[I'm sure it's nothing.]

%% TITLEMAP_lane_m_meet_2
No, just forget about it, sorry.
\cr[God damn it.]

%% TITLEMAP_lane_m_meet_3
No, I've definitely seen you.
\cq[What is it?]

@@ TITLEMAP_lane_m_nothing_0
Hmm... Well, whatever. Say, do you like RPG games? Also, where exactly
are we? I feel like I know *you*...

\cn[These subject hops are a bit hard to follow. I wonder if people find
me this hard to follow.]

@@ TITLEMAP_lane_m_nothing_5
Don't you hate it when they make you grind to get a 100% run? It's
just kind of mean to do that. Why not just make hidden areas?

\cn[I'm kind of perplexed. I did just finish a 100% run of an RPG
recently, and I did end up thinking that. Weird.]

\c-Anyways!

@@ TITLEMAP_lane_m_nothing_6
Strange! Were you passing into Hell, by chance? I think we might be in
some kind of precipice - a dream, perhaps!

\cn[She's surprisingly happy about this revelation.]

%% TITLEMAP_lane_m_nothing_1
I do like RPG games. Why?
\ct[Probably best to ignore the rest for now.]

%% TITLEMAP_lane_m_nothing_2
I'm not sure where we are. I just... woke up here.
\ct[I'm probably in Hell.]

%% TITLEMAP_lane_m_nothing_3
Why *do* we think we look alike, anyhow?
\cq[Maybe this was worth questioning.]

%% TITLEMAP_lane_m_nothing_4
Nevermind, you talk a mile a minute.
\cr[Not that I'm one to talk.]

@@ TITLEMAP_lane_m_seen_0
Hmm... Do you happen to have scars on your upper arms?

\cn[...What? How?]

%% TITLEMAP_lane_m_seen_1
No.
\cr[Fuck.]

%% TITLEMAP_lane_m_seen_2
...Yes. Burn marks. Self-inflicted.
\cr[*Fuck.*]

@@ TITLEMAP_lane_m_seen_3
...Ah.

\cn[Ah...]

%% TITLEMAP_lane_m_seen_4
I'm leaving.
\cr[I want to die. \cgI want to die. \cmI want to die.\cr]

%% TITLEMAP_lane_m_seen_5
I see.
\cr[We're the same person. \cmGod damn it.\cr]
