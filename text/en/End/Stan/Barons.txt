As you're flung through the gate your body is desynthesized.
If the demons were really smart enough they'd have stopped there.

Your body is in Deimos now... but something feels wrong.
The air is humid and hot as hell, and reality bends around you.

The walls seem to flex and twitch with your every movement.
You look up to the sky and see nothing but red;

Deimos is in Hell itself!

You ready yourself for the coming onslaught.
