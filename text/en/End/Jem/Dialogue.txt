\cgTerrifying! \cmHa ha ha.
\cyA human comes to our domain.

%% \#BOSS_BAR_2_Jem
\cgAn intrepid hero comes through the portal.
\cyDon't fret though. It'll be over quite soon.

%% \#BOSS_BAR_3_Jem
\cgWhat in the world are you? Some kind of insane robot?
\cyThis place is cursed. If you leave, it will only be worse.

%% \#BOSS_BAR_4_Jem
\cgWhatever you are, you shall not pass.
\cyDeimos is ours now. I think it's only fair to tell you.

== \#BOSS_BAR_5_Jem | $\#BOSS_BAR_5_Lane

%% \#BOSS_BAR_6_Jem
\ctYour life is forfeit.

%% \#BOSS_BAR_7_Jem
\cgIt won't be long now until your pathetic race is
wiped from this universe.
\cyIt will be too late by the time you get through the gate.

%% \#BOSS_BAR_8_Jem
\cgAs amusing a thought as that is, for such a worm to come here...
\cyWe offer a battle you have no chance of winning.

%% \#BOSS_BAR_9_Jem
\cgInteresting. Very interesting. I'll see to your demise.
\cyIt will be less painful than what you would go through.

%% \#BOSS_BAR_10_Jem
\ctPrepare to die.

%% \#BOSS_CYB_1_Jem
Interesting. Another one has climbed all the way up here.

You're much, much too late.

%% \#BOSS_CYB_2_Jem
I can allow you a fight, however.
You have withstood my barrier quite excellently.

%% \#BOSS_CYB_3_Jem
You are quite a piece of work. Not to berate you,
but it's quite ugly to have so much technology
shoved into the kind of pile of flesh that
you humans have.

%% \#BOSS_CYB_4_Jem
If you were truly so strong,
why would you have to modify your body so heavily?
I just can't understand it.
Do you think you'll become something else,
just by replacing parts of flesh with metal?

%% \#BOSS_CYB_5_Jem
A real, superior being knows better.
We'll always be what we always were,
and we'll always acknowledge it.
Other beings just can't understand that.

%% \#BOSS_CYB_6_Jem
Hahahahahaha! I feel like a fucking fool.
Talking to a human as if we could ever be equals.

No, you aren't worth my time.

%% \#BOSS_CYB_7_Jem
You can't even use the forces of absolute power
this realm holds. It's like watching children
in a sand box filled with sulfur. Fucking moron.

%% \#BOSS_CYB_8_Jem
You look like you're ready to die.
Are you seriously someone capable of withstanding me?
It almost seems like a joke, but here you are.

%% \#BOSS_CYB_9_Jem
No, if you were really so weak, your intestines
would be all over the walls right now.
I can see that you channel your energy from somewhere.

Wherever it may be, it must be long gone by now.

%% \#BOSS_CYB_10_Jem
Did I strike a nerve?

Good.

Now fuck off and die.

## Spider-Demon ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╕
%% \#BOSS_SPI_1_Jem
A-hah! Finally one comes who...

No, wait.

%% \#BOSS_SPI_2_Jem
Yes, I can tell. You...

I will have to think.

%% \#BOSS_SPI_3_Jem
In the meanwhile. I will offer you some advice.

You will take it.

%% \#BOSS_SPI_4_Jem
The beings here will not understand you.
I'm sorry that I do.
Had we met in different circumstances,
I may not have to kill you.

I'm sorry.

%% \#BOSS_SPI_5_Jem
I can see in your memories experiences much like mine.

A few different choices and we'd be the same.

But we diverge.

%% \#BOSS_SPI_6_Jem
You can't understand why you're wrong.
You're simply incapable.
You don't see reality, like you've got goggles on
that give a rose tint to your ideal world.

You can't face the facts.

%% \#BOSS_SPI_7_Jem
No one will empathize with you.
Your modifications do not change who you are.
And most importantly,

you seek such disgust in your masters
that you abhor them and become violent.
It is utterly disgusting.

%% \#BOSS_SPI_8_Jem
You are utterly disgusting.

Your line will die out.

%% \#BOSS_SPI_9_Jem
Such a small divergence creates such a massive difference.

What a shame. You're disappointing after all.

%% \#BOSS_SPI_10_Jem
You will be the last in line.

Your friends are gone. Your family slain.
Whatever you had left must have been shattered long ago.
Whatever you work for now is hilarious by comparison.
Burning a candle that ran out of wick long ago.

Enough.

@@ \#BOSS_IOS_1_Jem
You fucking scum.

You are not worthy of being here.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_2_Jem
My defeat is impossible from the likes of you.

If you had the slightest microcosm
of humanity left in you, maybe you
wouldn't be so fucking pathetic.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_3_Jem
This is the end.
You will not see your friends in the afterlife.
This realm already consumed them.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_4_Jem
What a disgusting pile of flesh,
not even in its original form,
like the Gods should have intended.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_5_Jem
They're idiots.
They shouldn't even be considered Gods
when they can't create a species
capable of subservience.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_6_Jem
As for you, I think you're much the same.
So much deception.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_7_Jem
You defy your masters,
you defy your humanity,
you defy your very body.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_8_Jem
Stupid girl.
Do you think those modifications could possibly trick me?
Even if they could, I know your origins.
You come from Delsona.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_9_Jem
It's too bad you couldn't save any of those who were captured.
Your society is fucking laughable.

%% \#BOSS_IOS_10_Jem
A bunch of idiotic sheep waiting to be herded.
I think I've had my fun now.
I won't bother assimilating you.
\cgYou\c- will simply fade into nonexistence.
