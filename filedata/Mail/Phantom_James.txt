\ccI woke in a \cudark place\cc, unsure of my fate; if my life was renewed out of cruel retribution or of a final opportunity.

\ccI wandered this hell, more real and yet more dream-like than I thought possible, seeking any sign of escape; any sign of pity from the monsters that inhabit this place.

\ccNo, the fate of the damned is but this.

\ccI can only guess that my family went to Heaven and that I was left the lone sinner.

\cgThank you for putting this to an end.
