An explosion of some sort just happened nearby, it seems that the demons are
reconstructing the world around you. You would best be careful not to trigger
any other, er, events.

Enough of those and the whole world around you might collapse!

You've been making good progress so far. Your military superiors seem to be
considering giving you a promotion, even.

Lambert out.
