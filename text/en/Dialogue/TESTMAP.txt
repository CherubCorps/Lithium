Hi.

Hey.

Too bad.

What did you need, Stilko?

== TESTMAP_jacques_start_talking_1c | The nightmares are back.

== TESTMAP_jacques_start_talking_1 | That's rude.

Life is rude.

Now go away.

%% TESTMAP_jacques_division_0
thousands are sailing
the same self    the only self

self willed the peril of a thousand fates

a line of infinite ends    finite finishing
the one remains oblique and pure

arching to the single point of consciousness

find yourself
starting back

== TESTMAP_jacques_division_1 | Oh. Okay.

@@ TESTMAP_jacques_c_what_asic_0
 Already? Are you sure it isn't just ASIC bugs? I have trouble
believing that they'd be back so soon, after your doctor gave you that
prescription and even turned down your AS-voltage.

 You know, ASIC hardware reacts to changes. It might just be that it's
settling to the new voltage and giving you a hard time.

== TESTMAP_jacques_c_what_asic_1 | It's not that, I'm certain.. They're \cmworse\c-.
== TESTMAP_jacques_c_what_asic_2 | Right... Thank you, Zeke.

@@ TESTMAP_jacques_c_zj_0
 I know how that is. You know, Order doesn't pass through this part of
the ship. You could say "Zeke" again if you want. I know they don't
like the names we give ourselves, but we're not infront of them. We at
least have that freedom.

 If you want, I can call you "Jem," too. Though I'd rather you of all
people not get in trouble for being called by your true name.

== TESTMAP_jacques_c_zj_1 | Thanks, 'Z.'

@@ TESTMAP_jacques_c_troubled_0
 Heh.. "Z." You're quite creative.

 There's trouble in your voice, though. I know you usually tremble,
but right now it seems even worse than usual. What's wrong, "J?"

== TESTMAP_jacques_c_troubled_1 | ... The nightmares are back.

@@ TESTMAP_jacques_c_worse_0
 Worse?

 ...

 You can feel in them now, right? That's why you're trembling.

== TESTMAP_jacques_c_worse_1 | Yeah. And I don't want to go to the doctor.

 ...

 Is there anything I can do to help? It's not a lack of food or
something, right?

== TESTMAP_jacques_c_malnutrition_1 | You'd have told me if you could hear it, right?

@@ TESTMAP_jacques_c_thebeat_0
 Are you hearing a beat? It could be your home calling for you. I'd
imagine AOF didn't put much use to that planet after they went and
captured you, it's probably just aching for its mana to be used.

== TESTMAP_jacques_c_thebeat_1 | That's not it, I always hear that. What I hear now is.. darker.

@@ TESTMAP_jacques_c_darker_0
 Darker...

 Then, do you think that it's come? Doesn't ever come excluding
incantation, vile, enroaching reality, Hell?

== TESTMAP_jacques_c_darker_1 | It's coming. Just thought I'd let you know.
