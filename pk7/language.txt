But what we can do is get the kernel to execute code for us, specifically when it's already in ring 0. Well, you may have noticed Solomon's name in the mission parameters looked a bit off. Since he was the instructor, we set his name to overflow a certain buffer during a kernel call, overflowing straight into a function pointer. Just point that right next to the fixed address, and bam. Kiloword boundaries give us plenty of space to write a self-modifying program in that padding space.\n\nThis also included some other vital parts besides the lock remover and the decompiler, mainly the graphics for your weapon materializers. (Sorry they don't look so great, the raw optic nerve image format is rather large.)

You will have to be careful not to trip it, but for the most part, it just doesn't have permissions to track anything we're doing.
