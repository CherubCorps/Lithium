This is a military issue Heads Up Display program, which tracks vital signs,
munitions, armor status, and more with numeric signifiers.

Originally designed by a former video game designer, a great amount of effort
had to be put into fine-tuning this program to tell you exactly when you're
about to die, your armor is about to break and get you killed, or you're about
to run out of ammunition, and then die.

These are standard jet boots produced by OFMD, upgraded for private use. They
have a safety lock which deactivates while the user is mid-air so they don't
backfire and burn your heels. Keeps the user smoothly held in air with a
stabilizer chassis attached to the leg, so your natural instinct to screw it
up is cancelled out.

Powered with a small energy cell about the size of your Calcaneus that can
stay stable mid-air for approximately 7 months without fail.

Press "run" while mid-air to activate.

Developed by avians of the planet Durla Prime, this armor plating is able to
mitigate damage of one type almost completely for an indefinite amount of time.

This plating uses a set of unique systems that can each block one kind of
attack with extreme prejudice, but due to allowing full control of the
plating to each system, can only use one at a time.

Works over your currently equipped armor, so damage from even rockets may be
lowered into what feels like a small tickle.

modifying any kind of weaponry with extreme ease; In fact, it is built to
completely disassemble, install upgrades into, and reassemble a weapon in under
20 seconds.

The package was created approximately 30 years ago by researchers at OFMD and
AllPoint. Them both seeing the potential sales figures for such a device during
a great war, OFMD and AllPoint signed a mutual contract to develop the package
and share profits between eachother.
